1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,700
Eagle, say again.
Repeat, please, Eagle.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,800
Zero One Zero, can you confirm deployment?

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,800
Roger that, Eagle. Stand by.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,600
Copy that. We got target confirmed.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,800
Eagle is green for go.
Repeat, Eagle is green for go.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
Copy that. Deployment in 15 seconds.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,200
Bombardier, give me a confirm
on target Three Zero Niner.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,800
That's Three Zero Niner, confirm.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,100
Copy, Bombardier. OK.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
In three... two... one.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Falling.

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,700
My worst fear is falling.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Falling like a bomb.

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,700
You see, life for me is about distractions.

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,800
I try to keep looking up
and forget about what's down.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
But when I dream,

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,800
I fall.

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Left.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Left.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Left.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,700
Old soldier

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
Old soldier

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,400
Combat soldier

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,300
Combat soldier

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,900
Pick up your weapon and follow me

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,800
Pick up your weapon and follow me

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
Follow me to victory

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,400
Follow me to victory

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,900
1-0-1

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,900
1-0-1

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Screaming Eagles

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Screaming Eagles

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Pick up your weapon and follow me

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,100
Pick up your weapon and follow me

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,800
Follow me to victory

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Follow me to victory

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,300
82nd

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
82nd

39
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,000
Airborne soldier

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Airborne soldier

41
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,300
Pick up yourjumpers and follow me

42
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,300
Pick up yourjumpers and follow me

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Follow me to victory

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,000
Follow me to victory...

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Man, you grabbed me. You grabbed me.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,300
You can't do that, man. Well, it's a foul.

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,300
I didn't grab you.

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,600
Dude, you grabbed me then.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
You can't do that.

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,600
Man, I didn't grab you.

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,800
Why are you lying?

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,100
Man, Elwood. Yo, Elwood, man.

53
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,800
He grabbed me, right? You saw it.

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
I don't know. Maybe.

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,600
- See, man, you can't grab like that.
- Fuck you, man.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,700
- Fucking holding...
- You wanna try it again, motherfucker?

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,200
Let's go, baby.
Hey, Video, throw me the goddamn ball.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,900
OK, but I'm quarterback. Can I be?

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
- Come on. Come on.
- All right. Let's see what they got.

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,100
Hey, yo, can I play?

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,600
Whoa, Parsons, got something for me there?

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,400
- You put it in the battery?
- Yeah, no problem.

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,300
Hey, can I play?
I was champion wide receiver at high school.

64
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,600
I can catch that ball, man.

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
- You're so fucked up, you couldn't catch a bus.
- Don't be such a pussy and let him play.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,100
Come on. Get down. Get down.

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
On "hutt". Down.

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
Come on. Come on.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,400
- Gimme some action.
- Hutt.

70
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
These were my guys.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,900
Fighting the dull fight.

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,700
Soldiers with nothing to kill except time.

73
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,400
They know that war is hell,

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
but peace...

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
peace is fucking boring.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Give me back the motherfucking ball.

77
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,300
Er, guys.

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Guys.

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Guys!

80
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,200
What?

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,100
Er, just letting you know.

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
Parsons is dead.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Parsons McCovey
was a casualty of war.

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,000
The only difference was that this was
the Cold War and he was a fucked-up junkie.

85
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,400
There'd be no hero's burial for Parsons.

86
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,400
I regret the death of your son immensely.

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,300
There was nobody in the battalion
I would have trusted more with my life.

88
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,900
In him were resplendent
the virtues of honour and loyalty

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,800
to his country and God,
that keep our civilisation together.

90
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,600
He fell off the rooftop
while making technical repairs

91
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,000
to the antennae that guard against the enemy.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,900
Technical repairs? Where did that come from?

93
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,400
I tried to think
what McCovey might be doing up there.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,600
OK, go on.

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
He died, though not in combat,
in the line of duty,

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,100
and he had his country uppermost in his mind.

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,900
My deepest regrets, Colonel Wallace Berman,
US Army, Commanding.

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
You kept this one short.

99
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,000
I thought it might be better
not to get lost in detail, sir.

100
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,600
I like the touch about me
trusting him with my life.

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a new angle, sir.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Here's something, though.

103
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
The word "resplendent".

104
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,000
That's not a good word to describe a soldier.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
We'd better come up with something else there.

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,800
What about "contained"? In him
were contained the virtues of honour and loyalty.

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,200
- That's much better.
- Oh, much better, sir.

108
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,600
Don't let the word "resplendent" leave this base.

109
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,200
Yes, sir.

110
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
OK. What is this? What have we here?

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,100
Just some requisitions, sir.

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,400
1,000 gallons of Mop & Glo.

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
My God. Do we really need that much?

114
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,800
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

115
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
Herman the German. How goes it?

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,700
How do you do, mein Freund? How are you?

117
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Doing just fine. Just fine.

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,000
Shall we do business today?

119
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,200
Sure thing. Guys.

120
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
I think you'll be pleased.

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,700
That's beautiful.

122
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Look at the sparkle.

123
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,800
That's real cleaning power.

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,900
Sehr gut Sheiße, ja?

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,600
Sehr gut Sheiße, mein Freund.

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,400
US Army's finest. 500 gallons ready to go.

127
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,400
Three things I love about Germany:

128
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
My Mercedes-Benz:

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
No speed limit on the autobahn:

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,800
And a black market
for anything I can get my hands on.

131
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
Fight The Power

132
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,800
The number, another summer

133
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
Sound of the funky drummer

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,400
Music hittin' your heart
cos I know you got soul

135
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Brothers and sisters

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Listen if you're missing y'all

137
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,300
Swingin' while I'm singin'

138
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,900
Givin' what you're gettin',
knowin' what I know

139
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,600
While the Black bands sweatin'

140
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
And the rhythm rhymes rollin'

141
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Got to give us what we want

142
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Gotta give us what we need

143
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,200
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,700
We gotta fight the powers that be

145
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,700
Let me hear you say

146
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Fight the power

147
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Fight the power

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Fight the power

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Fight the power...

150
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,100
Hey, Elwood, what's up?

151
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,100
Outstanding, Hicks. How you doing?

152
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
So...?

153
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
You don't look so good, Hicks.

154
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
- You got anything?
- Depends on what you want.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Er, it's... horse.

156
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Can't help you.

157
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,900
You know, fuck, Elwood.

158
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,800
I outrank you, man, so don't give me any... crap.

159
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I appreciate that, but I can't help you.

160
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Look, man, I don't do retail. I only cook the shit.

161
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,300
Why don't you go see Sergeant Saad?

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,800
There's basically
two types of guys in the army -

163
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,300
the motherfuckers and the motherfucked.

164
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,600
Sergeant Saad is the third kind.
He fucks the motherfuckers.

165
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,400
Which is doable
when you're the chief MP by day

166
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,900
and the director of retail heroin sales by night.

167
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,100
Something that makes my life simple.

168
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,100
I just cook high-grade Turkish morphine
into smack and wholesale it straight to him.

169
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,500
Everyone's happy.

170
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
So, how much we get?

171
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,700
Well, after we give the Turk back his share,
we got er... nine grams.

172
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,200
Nine grams? Six hours of cooking
and all we get is nine grams?

173
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,900
You wanna tell the Turk
you're not happy, be my guest.

174
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Bullshit. We're the ones doing all the work,
taking all the risks,

175
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,600
and Saad's making all the profit.

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,300
Garcia, I just need you to do your job.

177
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Can you watch those thermometers
and keep your mouth eating those hotdogs?

178
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,200
Heroin, cocaine, marijuana,
lysergic acid, diethyl... Whatever the hell it is.

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Amphetamines, traces of barbiturates,
estrogen...

180
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Estrogen?

181
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
McCovey was on the pill?

182
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
How could this be possible?

183
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,700
- Well, he might have taken it by mistake, sir.
- What?

184
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,200
The pill. He might have thought
it was something else.

185
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,700
Fine, but he didn't take heroin,
speed and cocaine by mistake, did he?

186
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,100
It seems unlikely, sir.

187
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,600
This isn't good, Elwood,
drugs on a base like this.

188
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,100
Did you know anything about this?

189
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,000
How could someone get drugs in?

190
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,900
I really don't know, sir.

191
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,300
I always try to keep away
from people like McCovey.

192
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,600
Elwood, we've got to try to clear this matter up,
goddamn it.

193
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
I cannot... Scratch that.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,700
I will not have this kind of thing
going on at my base.

195
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
Do you understand what I'm saying?

196
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,100
My officer evaluation report goes
in front of General Lancaster in three weeks.

197
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,700
If I don't get that goddamn star, I'm finished.

198
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,700
- Sir, you've got to relax...
- Don't you tell me to relax!

199
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,900
You're an E4. I'm a goddamn full-bird colonel.
You don't talk to me like that.

200
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,100
- You understand me, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

201
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Oh, Jesus, Elwood, I'm...

202
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,700
I didn't mean to take it out on you.

203
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
Elwood, I'm... I'm sorry.

204
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,700
It's OK, sir. I understand
the kind of pressure you're under.

205
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,300
This isn't mine.

206
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
I don't know anything about it.

207
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,600
And there's no smoking in here.

208
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,700
I need someone to sign here. It says Berman.
You're Berman?

209
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,700
I'm Colonel Berman, all right, but I don't know
anything about any goddamn chair.

210
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,700
- I'm telling you, son, it's not mine.
- It is yours.

211
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,600
- Oh, Liz. Hello, darling.
- Isn't it beautiful? It's for you.

212
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,100
It's for me?

213
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,700
I got it for under 30.
They didn't know what they had.

214
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,700
- 30 thousand?
- I couldn't believe it was so cheap.

215
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,500
- Dollars or Deutschmarks?
- What do you think, Elwood?

216
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, can you sit on it, ma'am?

217
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,500
Of course you can't sit on it. It's an antique.

218
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,700
Oh, well, it's very nice.

219
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Darling,

220
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,800
can I borrow Elwood for a few hours?
There's some things I need him to do.

221
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
God.

222
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,500
Wait. Almost. Almost.

223
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,700
...under the deal signed exactly a year ago
in Stockholm to build East-West trust,

224
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,500
and reduce the risk of war.

225
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,900
East and West have always feared
that such an enormous exercise

226
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,000
might be used as a cover for a build-up for war.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You didn't make it yet?

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sorry. You angry?

229
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,900
No.

230
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,900
Ray, honey. I need you to do me a favour.

231
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,700
The Colonel's giving a party
and I need you to find out about decorations.

232
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,700
- What's he want a party for?
- He wants to impress the General.

233
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,300
His position's under review
and I thought a party would help.

234
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Will you?

235
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Hm?

236
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,900
Oh, you mean a party party?

237
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,800
Like for everyone's fun.

238
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Oh.

239
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,500
...are procedures
to ensure no cheating in future.

240
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,300
And all sides agree this first onside verification
of conventional forces

241
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,100
is a major step forward
in building new trust and confidence.

242
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Can you switch that off?

243
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,300
Just turn that engine off, come on over here.

244
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,100
- Is there a problem?
- Where are you taking this Hummer?

245
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,900
We have orders from Colonel Berman.

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,300
OK. Who are you?

247
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,400
Specialist Ray Elwood.

248
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
What's this?

249
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,700
We have orders
to pick up party decorations in Mannheim.

250
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,800
Party decorations?

251
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,100
Yes, First Sergeant.
Colonel's having a party.

252
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,300
Sounds like a pretty dangerous mission.

253
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
No disrespect intended,
but may I ask who you are?

254
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,900
Yeah, you can ask.

255
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,700
I'm your new Top. First Sergeant Robert E Lee.

256
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,100
Well, pleased to meet you, Top.

257
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,700
Welcome to the 3-17th.

258
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,100
Thanks, Specialist.

259
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,300
- I didn't know we were getting a new Top.
- Why would you?

260
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,200
I'm Battalion Clerk here.
I usually do paperwork on all the transfers.

261
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
OK, thanks, guys. I'm sorry to keep you.

262
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
No problem.

263
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,000
Hold it for a second there.

264
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,700
You got the time, son?

265
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,900
Oh, yeah, it's almost ten.

266
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,100
That's a nice watch. Show me that.

267
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Where did you get that?

268
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,700
My father gave it to me.

269
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,300
Your father gave it to you?

270
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,100
He must be quite a guy. What's he do?

271
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,800
He's a barber.

272
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Barber?

273
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,900
Gee, he must cut a lot of hair.

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

275
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,100
OK, better be going, then.

276
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Don't wanna be late
picking up them party decorations.

277
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,900
Let's go.

278
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,700
Bear Witness

279
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,800
Bravo Two Zero.
Bravo Two Zero, come in.

280
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,800
Bravo Two Zero. Bravo Two Zero, come in.

281
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Shit! Turn that down, man.
Turn down the fucking music, man.

282
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,900
Bravo Two Zero, please respond.
What's going on, Hicks?

283
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,800
Er... Bravo Two Zero here.

284
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,200
Bravo Two Zero, commence tactical
manoeuvre area Two Niner Alpha Romeo.

285
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,400
Take position on phase line
Foxtrot Delta Four Seven.

286
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Fuck.

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,700
What the hell's Two Nine Alpha Romeo?

288
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,100
I got a very weird vibe from that guy.
I personally didn't like him.

289
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,500
- He's our new Top. What do you expect?
- What was that shit about the Rolex, man?

290
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,700
He could know about the operation,
he could know something.

291
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,100
Jesus Christ, don't get fucking paranoid, Garcia.
Just be cool.

292
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,300
I'm cool.

293
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,600
- Fuck, man. I can be cool.
- Good. That's why I'm telling you.

294
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,500
Figured out where we're going yet, man?

295
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,000
Er, no. We're going the wrong way.

296
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,400
Shit, er... Hey, Johnnie,

297
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
make a... a left.

298
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,500
I told you to make a left across that field.

299
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,300
I did, man. I went left.

300
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,100
Ich Bin Ein Arschloch

301
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,700
What was that bump?

302
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,100
Oh, shit, man.

303
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,100
We just ran over a car, man.
We just squashed a car.

304
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
What kind of car?

305
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,100
A Volkswagen. A fucking Beetle.

306
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, no.

307
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
We squashed a Beetle.

308
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
Look out, man.

309
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,100
Stop.

310
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,400
Stop!

311
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,300
What's going on?

312
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,400
What the hell are you doing here?

313
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,600
- Whoa!
- Stop!

314
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,900
Stop.

315
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,300
- These dudes are freaking me out.
- I don't like 'em, either.

316
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey, Johnnie, why don't you just
get us away from these fuckers?

317
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,900
What the fuck is he doing?

318
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,200
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

319
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,000
What's wrong with these monitors?
They've gone all orange.

320
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Johnnie, I thought I told you
to get us out of here.

321
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,400
That's our fucking unit.

322
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,700
Just up ahead.

323
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,900
Is that you back there, Bravo Two Zero?

324
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,500
Did you complete
your Two Niner Alpha Romeo?

325
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,100
Er... We er... completed that.

326
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,000
OK, good work, guys. Get in formation.

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
Holy shit!

328
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,400
Oh, Jesus Christ!

329
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,200
These guys are dead.

330
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,300
Garcia, get in that truck and follow me.

331
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
What?

332
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,300
- Hey, what's in the trucks?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

333
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,700
- Hey, no way, man.
- Just get in the fucking truck.

334
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,900
All right.

335
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Uh-oh.

336
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
Jackpot.

337
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,600
Oh, shit. Holy shit!

338
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,400
Grenade launchers.

339
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,100
MAG guns, stinger missiles.

340
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,100
Jesus Christ, this is worth millions.
3 million maybe.

341
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,500
- Maybe $5 million.
- It's all brand-new.

342
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,800
We gotta take this back.
This stuff gets us nothing but heavy jail time.

343
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,900
- We're not taking this back.
- It's big time. We can retire on this.

344
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,500
I agree 100%/.

345
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
This is way out of our league.

346
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,800
They kill you for stuff like this.

347
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,200
This is very serious shit.

348
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,700
- There's no time like now. If we pull this off...
- There's no time like now? Are you crazy?

349
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,200
We're not weapons dealers.

350
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Would you kindly shut up?
Man, you're so negative. I'm trying to think.

351
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,700
Hey.

352
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,000
We're smart, right?

353
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Yeah.

354
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Now, we could do this.

355
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
- We could do this.
- Oh, man.

356
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,300
What do we do with this shit?

357
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,000
Well, first we need to store it.
And I know the perfect place.

358
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,000
Hey, this place gives me the creeps.

359
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, it's supposed to.

360
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,100
- Hey, friend, what's up?
- Hey, Elwood.

361
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,800
What's going on, man?

362
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,200
Nothing much. I got some stuff I need to store.
Can you help me out?

363
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,900
Sure thing, man.

364
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,100
Hey, are we gonna party afterwards?

365
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,900
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

366
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,400
Hey, we can do a lot of things
with the cash we make off this.

367
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,600
You know what I'm saying?

368
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,100
Cos I was thinking about opening up a bar,
a nice, classy place.

369
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,800
Me and you'd be partners.

370
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,000
What do you think?

371
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Sure.

372
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,300
Why not?

373
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Fuck!

374
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
This one ready to go?

375
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Yeah, almost. Almost.

376
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Easy.

377
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
You be all right?

378
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,200
Yeah.

379
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,600
- You ain't out in 30, I'm coming in.
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.

380
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Turkish music

381
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,800
- Elwood, how are you, my friend?
- Hey, Davood, how are you?

382
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,200
- Are you hungry? You want something to eat?
- Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks. I'd better get up.

383
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,700
Say hi to your sister, all right?

384
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,100
A lot of guns.

385
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,800
Where did you get all this stuff?

386
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,900
Santa Claus.

387
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,200
Santa Claus. That's funny.

388
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,400
He came down the chimney
and put it under the tree, hm?

389
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Yup.

390
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
So...

391
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,200
...how about this?

392
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,500
I give you 20 kilos on top of my next shipment,

393
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,600
and you cook that
along with my share of the shipment,

394
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
and you make a lot of money.

395
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,400
- 20 kilos?
- Mm.

396
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,600
No. I want cash.

397
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,300
25.

398
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,900
Look, I know somebody else
who's very interested in this merchandise.

399
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,000
OK.

400
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,000
Maybe they'll pay you cash.

401
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,700
35.

402
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,100
29.

403
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,400
I hate to break that 30 mark.
It's a religious thing with me.

404
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm afraid you'll have to,
cos 30 kilos is my final offer.

405
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,900
He's sending us 30Ks. One week.

406
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,400
30Ks?

407
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,600
Holy shit! That's, er...

408
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,900
- A lot.
- Well, how do we cook that much?

409
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,400
- It'll take us, like, a year.
- It's gonna be cool.

410
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,000
French Foreign Minister Dumas
yesterday expressed discomfort...

411
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,300
...has welcomed East German reforms
with such open arms.

412
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,700
Politically, Mr Gorbachev
has never been more vulnerable.

413
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,500
This is really impressive.

414
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,500
Hey, guys, careful with my shit.

415
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,100
You're pretty well equipped for a Spec Four.

416
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,600
I got receipts for everything.

417
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,900
I'm sure you do.

418
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,500
Hey, Top, look at this.

419
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,300
Check and see if there's anything inside.

420
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Nothing.

421
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,500
Hm? Mm-hm.

422
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I'll bet this don't come cheap.

423
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,300
This ain't exactly regulation stuff here,
is it, soldier?

424
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
I don't really know.

425
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,700
No, I guess not.

426
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,300
Look, I'm gonna come round here tomorrow.
I want this place looking like a regular quarters.

427
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,700
You follow?

428
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Look, I know it ain't exactly regulation,
but the last Top didn't seem to mind.

429
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,100
Well, him and me are a bit different.

430
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
Look, Top,

431
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,500
is there a way you and I could talk in private?

432
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,400
These guys kinda make me nervous.

433
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Does it really have to play this way, Top?

434
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,200
How do you suggest we play it?

435
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,200
Well, what is it you want?

436
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,200
I mean, you and me, I think we...
I think we got a lot in common.

437
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,500
Barriers are coming down in Hungary.

438
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,300
So must they fall
throughout all of Eastern Europe.

439
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,200
For example, I see you're an admirer
of Japanese technology.

440
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,700
No problem.

441
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,100
The TV's yours.

442
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,500
What I'm trying to say is,

443
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,000
what's it gonna take
for you and me to make nice?

444
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,400
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

445
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
The world has waited...

446
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,000
There's your answer.

447
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,100
Elwood.

448
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Hey, this'll take a second.

449
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,700
- I'll meet you down there.
- All right.

450
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,500
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

451
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,100
Nowhere, really.
Just had a couple of things to do.

452
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,300
You're always off with your buddies.
I never see you any more.

453
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,500
It's just cos I've been really busy.

454
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
- Busy?
- Yeah.

455
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
- It's the guest list.
- Guest list?

456
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,500
Party. Are you still helping me?

457
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,800
Oh, the par... Yeah. Sure. Definitely.

458
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,200
We found out the Colonel's related
to the Iron Boar.

459
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,300
- The Iron what?
- The Iron Boar, as in male pig.

460
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,700
I had a lawyer trace his family tree,
and he's a distant relative

461
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,900
of a Civil War hero, John Bell Hood.

462
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,100
They called him the Iron Boar.

463
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,600
He'll announce it to General Lancaster
at the party, to help his promotion.

464
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,200
Sergeant Lee's daughter.

465
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,500
That's Top's daughter? You're kidding.

466
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,100
See something you like, Elwood?

467
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
Nice dive.

468
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,400
Thanks.

469
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,700
The new Top, what do you think he's up to?

470
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,500
He's a washed-up vet
who wants to throw his weight around.

471
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,000
But right now he's on your case, my man.

472
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,700
Yeah, well.

473
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,500
Hey, check out this girl.

474
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
- Why?
- That's Top's daughter.

475
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No shit.

476
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,500
You know what I'm thinking?

477
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,100
You could be thinking almost anything.

478
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,700
- Maybe I should ask her out.
- You're fucking crazy, you know that?

479
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Imagine how much that'll fuck with his head.

480
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,700
It's perfect.

481
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Hey.

482
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,900
- So, have you got a problem with your car?
- Yeah. It won't start.

483
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,700
It might be the battery. Want me to look?

484
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,400
Hey, you're Robyn Lee, right?

485
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,100
Yeah. How d'you know that?

486
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm Battalion Clerk here for the First Battalion.
I kinda know everything.

487
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,300
Hm, must be handy.

488
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,700
Hey, you're a good diver.

489
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,700
I saw you in there at the pool,
diving off the high platform. How do you do that?

490
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,200
What do you mean? Are you scared of heights?

491
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,500
Let's just say you wouldn't get me up there.

492
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,000
You should try it.

493
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,600
It's fun.

494
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,900
Fun? Why is it fun?

495
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Falling through air. It's kinda cool.

496
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,300
You're kidding me. You like falling?

497
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,400
Sure. Why not?

498
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,600
Hey, I think I found the culprit.
You wanna give that a try?

499
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,800
- What a guy!
- That's me.

500
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,400
Actually, I'm Ray Elwood.

501
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,700
Everyone calls me Elwood.

502
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,600
- Thanks for fixing my car, Elwood.
- Yeah. No problem.

503
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,000
You wanna go out Friday night?

504
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,900
It's a vineyard I visited last summer,
just a small one in the Napa Valley.

505
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,500
Pinot grapes.

506
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
It's for sale.

507
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,500
- You thinking of buying it, sir?
- Well, I wish.

508
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,600
No. But I have a pretty decent collection
back home,

509
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,300
and I've always wondered what it would be like
to make my own wine.

510
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I could just about afford it.

511
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Of course it's unrealistic.

512
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,200
Have you heard about those two missing trucks?

513
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,300
- What trucks, sir?
- During Reforger two trucks went missing.

514
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,600
The drivers were killed in an accident with a tank
at some gas station out near Karlsruhe.

515
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,300
They found the bodies,
but they can't find the trucks.

516
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,900
How odd.

517
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,300
- You wanna hear the best part?
- What's that, sir?

518
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,300
It's Colonel Marshall's infantry,
so he's taking the heat.

519
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Great news, sir.

520
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,500
Elwood, could I tell you a little secret?

521
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,100
Of course, sir.

522
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,300
Have you heard
of the Civil War General John Bell Hood?

523
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
The Iron Boar?

524
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
You know of him?

525
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,900
- Everybody knows the Iron Boar.
- I didn't know he was so well known.

526
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,200
- Mm.
- It turns out that I am an actual relative.

527
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,900
A relative of the Iron Boar? Awesome.

528
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,300
I want you to keep it under your hat.
I'm gonna surprise the General at the party.

529
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,100
Excuse me.

530
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,700
Private First Class Brian Knoll
reporting for duty, sir.

531
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,400
I'm not an officer, so you can cut the "sir" crap.

532
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,900
- Sorry.
- What do you want?

533
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,200
I just arrived. The orderly sent me down here.

534
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,400
Oh, great. Is that your 201 file?

535
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Yes, sir. Er... yes.

536
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,300
You can sit down if you want.

537
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,800
So, how come they assigned you here?

538
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,000
I put in for it.

539
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,300
My fiancée is here on base,
so we arranged to transfer together.

540
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,900
Ah, how sweet.

541
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Who is she?

542
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,300
Margolis, Carol Ann, Private First Class.

543
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,100
You call her by her last name?
What do you do, salute in bed?

544
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,800
It says here they put you in 5-19.

545
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,900
Yeah.

546
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,000
That's my room.

547
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Didn't... Didn't Sergeant Lee tell you?

548
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,600
We're gonna be roommates.

549
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,300
So while Carol Ann's been here for six months,

550
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,100
I'm stuck in San Antonio,
just pulling whatever strings I could,

551
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,200
kissing the Base Commander's ass
like you would not believe, not literally, but...

552
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,300
Boy, oh, boy. I mean, so check this out.

553
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,400
- So then...
- Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up.

554
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
I guess I don't really give a shit.

555
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,600
You're only here cos Sergeant
fucking dickhead Lee's on my case.

556
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,400
Until I get that shit straightened out, I don't
wanna hear about your girlfriend, or anything.

557
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,100
You roger that?

558
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,100
Anderson underwent his rookie season
at Milwaukee as a starting quarterback...

559
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,400
Hiya, Top. How's it going?

560
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,600
- Daddy, this is Ray Elwood.
- Oh, yeah, we already met.

561
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I'm going out. I won't be home till late.

562
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,000
How the hell can you afford this car?

563
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,700
Oh, I got a great deal.

564
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,400
Mercs are a lot cheaper in Germany.

565
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
I don't believe it.

566
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
What?

567
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Your dad. He's following us.

568
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
I don't believe it.

569
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,700
Hey, how's it going?

570
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,400
- Hey, Elwood.
- Looking good.

571
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Hey!

572
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Alle schon da.

573
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,200
Tut mir Leid.

574
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,700
Mit diesen Schuhen können Sie nicht rein.

575
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Blue Monday

576
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,700
What's going on with you and my dad?

577
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,200
What do you mean?

578
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
There's something going on.

579
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm the natural enemy of guys like your dad,
mostly cos I don't give a shit about the army.

580
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,700
If you don't give a shit, why did you join?

581
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,000
I didn't exactly have much of a say in the matter.

582
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,700
I got caught stealing a car
and the judge gave me a choice -

583
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,200
six months in prison or three years in the army.

584
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,600
- I made the mistake of choosing the army.
- I get it.

585
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
My dad has a problem with guys like you.

586
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,200
So you're out with me to piss him off?

587
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,600
No. I, er...

588
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,900
That's it, isn't it?

589
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,900
Yeah, that's...
I'm fucked up. I'm really sorry.

590
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah, that's definitely fucked up.

591
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,400
I'll take you home.
I didn't mean to get you into this.

592
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,100
Are you seriously out with me
just to piss off my dad?

593
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,300
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

594
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Are you crazy?

595
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,600
He's the First Sergeant of your company.
He's not somebody you wanna piss off.

596
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,000
You realise, he's gonna cut your balls off.

597
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,500
Yeah, probably.

598
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,000
So, what if I stay?
There's a chance you're gonna lose your balls.

599
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,500
Do you think I'm worth it?

600
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,700
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

601
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,800
Fine.

602
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,400
Do you want one of these?

603
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,800
- What is that?
- Ecstacy.

604
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,100
How does it feel

605
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,600
To treat me like you do?

606
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,200
When you've laid your hands upon me

607
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,600
And told me who you are

608
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,300
I thought I was mistaken

609
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,700
I thought I heard your words

610
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,100
Tell me, how do I feel?

611
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,600
Tell me now, how do I feel?

612
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,400
Those who came before me

613
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,100
Lived through their vocations

614
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
I've got something I wanna show you.

615
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,800
What is it?

616
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,200
A burn.

617
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,300
How did it happen?

618
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
When I was a kid, my dad was drunk

619
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,800
and he dropped a cigarette on my nightgown
and it caught fire.

620
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,800
It was an accident.

621
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,600
It's really ugly, isn't it?

622
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,800
Get up! Get up! Get up!

623
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,800
At the armoury. Full gear. Five minutes!

624
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Five minutes?

625
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,000
Count 'em.

626
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,000
- Elwood, what the hell are we doing?
- Target practice.

627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Elwood, hand me your rifle.

628
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
I want you to pack the M-60.

629
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,600
I'm not qualified to operate it.

630
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,800
There's a time and a place.
You're gonna learn in the heat of battle.

631
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,100
Hand it to him.

632
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,300
The 60's a heavy mother.

633
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,700
So am I.

634
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,200
What's the matter, Elwood?
Your fitness lacking?

635
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,800
You wanna do the confidence course
a few times to get you back into shape?

636
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
No, thanks, Top. I'll be fine.

637
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,100
I direct your attention to that spot over there
that has been marked with an X.

638
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,900
We have here the prototype
of a new Russian tank.

639
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:51,300
We are here to test the vulnerability of said tank
to sustain fire from an infantry platoon.

640
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,600
Squad...

641
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,500
Lock and load one magazine.
Take up a good firing position.

642
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,800
You will fire on my command.

643
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,100
Sustain fire until the order
to cease fire's been given.

644
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,500
Ready?

645
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,900
Fire!

646
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,700
So, you did Top's daughter?

647
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,700
Think I may have a problem.

648
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,200
No shit.

649
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,900
I like her.

650
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,100
I really like her, you know.

651
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,000
I mean, she's different, man. She's cool.
There's this... I just fucking dig her, you know.

652
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,100
That's a problem.

653
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,200
Yeah.

654
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,300
Elwood.

655
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,900
Heard you lost your ride, baby.

656
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,600
I was getting bored with that car.

657
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You'd better take note there, Stoney.
It ain't too healthy hanging around this guy.

658
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,700
Look at the shit he's making you eat.

659
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,000
Oh, you want some meatloaf, Saad?

660
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,100
That's a fucking insult to me.

661
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
I don't eat meat.

662
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,500
Human beings don't have the proper teeth
and can't digest that shit.

663
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,800
It stays in your guts for three weeks
and it rots.

664
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,100
That's your problem. You ain't got no discipline.

665
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,700
- Are you trying to make some point here, Saad?
- Yeah.

666
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,400
The cabinet in the storage room
was empty, man.

667
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,700
What do you mean, it was empty?

668
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,500
Empty. It means nothing was in it.

669
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,800
I paid my hard earned for thin fucking air.

670
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,900
You looked inside the battery, right?

671
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,300
Like always. Except this time nothing was in it.
What the fuck is that?

672
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,300
You trying to pick a fight with me, Elwood?

673
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,200
Is that what you really wanna do?

674
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,500
I sent Parsons there to stash it.

675
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,700
Stupid fucking junkie
probably did something with it.

676
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,100
Parsons ain't around.
Ain't that real fucking convenient?

677
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,300
Hey, relax, man. It's already sorted.
I got a brand-new batch ready for you.

678
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,800
Maintenance area at the swimming pool,
usual place.

679
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,100
I put it there myself. It's definitely there, OK?

680
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,500
It fucking better be.

681
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
You understand me?

682
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,800
Do you understand me?

683
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,100
This meatloaf looks great, doesn't it?

684
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,700
In the article... In the article there was a photo
of a Confederate General John Bell Hood,

685
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,900
affectio... affectio... affec...

686
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,800
affectionately known as the Iron Boar.

687
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,600
Known as the Iron Boar.

688
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,500
- The Iron Boar.
- Who are you talking to?

689
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,000
No-one. How are things going downstairs?

690
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,600
- Are you ready? Guests will be here soon.
- I'm coming.

691
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,300
I was reading a copy of The Modern Soldier,

692
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,100
and there was an article
on the guerrilla fighters in the Civil War.

693
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,800
There was a photo of the Confederate General
John Bell Hood, affectionately...

694
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,100
affec... affectionately known as the Iron Boar.

695
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,200
The Iron what?

696
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,500
Boar. B-O-A-R. As in male pig.

697
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,700
It was Liz who actually noticed it,

698
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,400
but the resemblance to myself
was absolutely uncanny.

699
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,900
So we commissioned a lawyer
to begin tracking down court records,

700
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,400
passenger ship lists, that sort of thing,
and it was finally confirmed just last week

701
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,300
via what is known round here
as the Lynchburg Convergence,

702
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,000
where a certain Trevor Berman and a hood girl
known as Ethel, wed and had two boys

703
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,000
in the town of Lynchburg, Virginia.

704
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,500
One of those boys, Gary Berman,

705
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,200
is my great-great-uncle.

706
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,100
A descendent of the wild boar.

707
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,700
Sir, that's the Iron Boar.

708
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,100
I guess I'm surrounded
by people with famous relatives.

709
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,400
Isn't that so, Marshall?

710
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,900
I try not to play it up,

711
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:57,100
but when I found out I was related to former
Army Chief of Staff General George C Marshall,

712
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,500
I guess it gave me
a strong sense of my heritage.

713
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,100
I've always been proud of my family,
but knowing that I was from fighting stock...

714
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,000
...affected me quite profoundly.

715
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,900
I seem to recall this General Hood.

716
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,900
He was involved in some disastrous battle

717
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,700
and lost a leg, didn't he?

718
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,600
I wouldn't say it was disastrous.

719
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,600
And an arm.

720
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,100
- He lost an arm as well, didn't he?
- No, he didn't lose an arm.

721
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,100
He lost the use of it. He kept the actual arm.

722
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,300
- Drink, General?
- Thank you.

723
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,900
Mrs Colonel.

724
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,600
You know what?

725
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,900
I don't go much for this lineage shit.

726
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,700
I'm not related to anyone famous and
this family line bullshit makes me feel insecure.

727
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,800
My belief is, if you come from dirt,

728
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,900
you fight better
because you don't wanna go back to the dirt.

729
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,800
The best fighters in the world
are people with nothing to lose.

730
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,900
Get me another one of these, will you?

731
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,300
Right away, sir.

732
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,700
- How's it going?
- Oh, the usual.

733
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,800
Berman and Marshall
trying to suck the General's dick.

734
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,300
What's he doing here?

735
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,500
I don't know.

736
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,700
It's supposed to be a party
for officers only.

737
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,400
Damn.
The General's sure happy to see his ass.

738
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,200
How's it going?

739
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,800
What you doing walking around here,
white boy? You crazy or something?

740
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,200
I'm just trying to get back to my room.
You know, I don't want any trouble, or...

741
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,400
No trouble?

742
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,400
OK.

743
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,400
You're with Elwood now, ain't you?
You Elwood's homey?

744
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,600
Yeah, he's my roommate.

745
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,400
Oh, you're roommates?

746
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,700
That's real nice, man.

747
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,100
Er, Scotch on the rocks
and a Coca-Cola, please.

748
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Didn't expect to see you here.

749
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,200
Yeah, well... here I am.

750
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,200
There you go.

751
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,700
Jesus Christ, look how they got you dressed up.

752
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,000
Ain't you sick of being fucked by a white man?

753
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,400
You and me can step outside right now.

754
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
Whoa!

755
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,900
You think you can take me?

756
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,900
Uh-oh, customers.

757
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,100
Yeah, maybe.
Straight up, hand to hand, you got a shot.

758
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,300
Maybe.

759
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,700
But maybe I wear a blade.

760
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,100
Maybe I got a.45 cocked and locked
to shove up your ass.

761
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,100
You ain't considered that, have you?

762
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,300
Hey, you wanna know something?

763
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,400
You ain't like Elwood here. You got guts.

764
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,700
Guys like you get all the medals.

765
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,500
Hey, Bob. Get your ass over here.
There's someone I want you to meet.

766
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,500
Excuse me.

767
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
He murdered your car?

768
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,400
Yeah, shot to pieces.
The entire unit used it for target practice.

769
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,700
Even me.

770
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,800
Why would he do that?
That's pretty extreme, even for him.

771
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,900
Yeah, that's what I thought.

772
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,700
Is there something going on I don't know about?

773
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,200
What do you mean?

774
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,500
Are you into some kind of shit on the side?

775
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,700
I've lived on base my whole life.
I know what goes on.

776
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,100
I also know my dad
doesn't take a disliking to just anyone.

777
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,100
Oh, really?

778
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,500
Yeah.

779
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,800
You're into something.

780
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,700
Aren't you?

781
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
A fiasco.

782
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,100
- A debacle even, wouldn't you say?
- Goddamn it, it was your idea.

783
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,800
- I'd never heard of the fucking Iron Boar.
- Do something, then.

784
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,200
Marshall's gonna take that promotion
if you don't.

785
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,000
Take the initiative, for God's sake.

786
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,700
You're a soldier. Go on the attack.

787
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,900
- I've got an idea.
- What?

788
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,900
- Leave it to me. Don't worry about it.
- Tell me. Tell me.

789
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,800
You have a serious problem.

790
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,600
My dad's a pretty heavy guy.
He'll really fuck you up.

791
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
When you say fuck me up, what do you mean?

792
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,400
I mean, fuck you right up.

793
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,400
He's done three tours of Vietnam.
He's killed a lot of people.

794
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,900
- Whoa. Are you saying he's gonna kill me?
- I don't know, but...

795
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
He's not a guy to mess with.

796
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,600
Why are you telling me all this?

797
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,300
I guess I don't want him to fuck you up.

798
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,300
You realise that's probably the nicest thing
anyone's said to me in my whole life?

799
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
I love this guy, don't you?

800
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,900
General?

801
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,500
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

802
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Yes.

803
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,400
What do you think about the idea
of a training exercise?

804
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,800
Er, what do you have in mind?

805
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,400
Well, with all this activity in the East,
I thought we should stay on our toes.

806
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,700
Maybe I could put a company of my men
up against Marshall's, see how they'd go.

807
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,400
Do you really think
you're up for this sort of thing?

808
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Oh, yes, sir. It could be
a straight defensive/offensive exercise.

809
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,300
Maybe the nuclear facility.
I could put my men on a full alert.

810
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,400
See how they'd hold up against an attack.

811
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,200
You want to defend the nuke base
against Marshall's infantry?

812
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,300
Yes, sir.

813
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,200
- Wallace, can I see you in the kitchen?
- Just a moment, honey.

814
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,500
Er, Marshall, what do you think?

815
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,700
Er... sounds good to me.

816
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,700
Excellent.

817
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,700
I think I know what your problem is.

818
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,000
What's that?

819
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,100
You're bored.

820
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,500
I think you're right.

821
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,700
Do you ever have falling dreams?

822
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,500
Sure. I think so.

823
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,800
I have the same dream all the time
where it's really high, I'm kinda floating,

824
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,600
and then I fall.

825
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,000
Is that the same as yours?

826
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,400
Kind of.

827
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Well, why, what happens in yours?

828
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,700
I wake up before I hit the ground.

829
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,600
I always hit.

830
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,800
I don't wake up.

831
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,900
That's not normal.

832
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,900
I know.

833
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,700
I got a bad feeling.

834
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,600
About what?

835
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Some strange shit's been going down.

836
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,000
Saad's up to something, and it's nothing good.

837
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,400
I keep thinking
about that stash that disappeared.

838
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,100
I mean, Parsons was stupid, but he wasn't crazy.
He wouldn't try to rip us off.

839
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,100
I'm going out to the storage room later,
check out that cabinet.

840
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,200
Maybe he put the stash in there wrong
and Saad couldn't find it.

841
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,600
OK.

842
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,300
Do you wanna kill Ray Elwood?

843
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,400
Jesus Christ, Robyn,
what are you talking about?

844
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,600
- Do you?
- What's he been saying?

845
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Nothing.

846
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,400
I don't think you should be listening too much
to Ray fucking Elwood.

847
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,300
But you've killed people before
in war and stuff, right?

848
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,700
And now you wanna kill Ray Elwood.

849
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,800
It's no different, is it?

850
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,200
I really don't think
you know what you're talking about.

851
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Holy shit, what happened to you?

852
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Who the fuck did that to you?

853
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,100
Fuckers.

854
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,200
They're just stupid, stupid, stupid... fuckers.

855
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,000
Take it easy. Let me look at you.

856
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,100
Oh, fuck!

857
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,400
Hey. Come on. Calm down.

858
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,100
Just let me clean it up, all right?
I've got some stuff here.

859
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,900
Put this under your tongue and let it dissolve.

860
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
What is that?

861
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,100
It'll calm you down.

862
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,900
Oh, fuck.

863
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,200
Man, I told you. You can't walk
around this end of the base alone at night.

864
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
It just ain't safe.

865
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Hey, you want a beer?

866
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,800
- I'll get you a beer, yeah?
- OK.

867
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Thanks.

868
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,400
You know, a lot of guys
take a beating around here.

869
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,200
Just don't let it happen twice.

870
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,800
My daddy still keeps in touch
with his army buddies.

871
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,600
The guys he knew... from World War II.

872
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,900
You know,
they get together every year for a barbecue.

873
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,400
Friends for life, man.

874
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,700
Yeah.

875
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,800
I guess I've been kind of an asshole to you.

876
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,200
This place is fucked up.

877
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,300
It fucks with your head, and...

878
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,800
sometimes you don't know who to trust,
you know?

879
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah.

880
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,400
Well, I think tonight ended up OK.
Don't you think?

881
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,000
A stunning success. You should be very happy.

882
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,000
Liz,

883
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,200
why don't you put that down for a while?

884
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,400
Hm?

885
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,600
- Well, honey, it's been a while.
- Wallace.

886
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,200
- Who do you think you are?
- What do you mean?

887
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,600
When was the last time you even held a rifle?

888
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,300
Do you even know which end
the fucking bullets come out?

889
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,400
Why, in your opinion, was it a good idea
to challenge Marshall to a training exercise

890
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,600
when you're Supply and he's Infantry?

891
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,300
You told me I should go on the attack.

892
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,200
Right. I said attack.
I didn't say fall on your own sword.

893
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,400
Well, I had to do something, and...

894
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,800
And I'll tell you what.

895
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,600
I think I've got Marshall's number.

896
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,800
I know how he thinks,
I know his battle strategies.

897
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,000
I've been supplying him in Reforger,
for God's sake.

898
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,100
I'm confident I can show him up.

899
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,600
All I've got to do
is defend a nuke base for 48 hours.

900
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,700
Right?

901
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,200
The deal's off, sir.

902
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,800
I don't understand.

903
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,400
What do you mean, it's off?

904
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,300
There's just some bad shit happening right now
and I can't do it. I'm sorry.

905
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,700
The guns are already sold.

906
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,800
If you don't deliver, there's a big problem.

907
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,700
They killed one of my guys.

908
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,700
What did you expect?

909
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,500
Did you think this would be like a game?

910
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,400
A bit of fun?

911
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,500
I don't know.

912
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,700
Yeah.

913
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,100
Sit down, please.

914
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,500
Please sit down.

915
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,800
We got nothing left to talk about.

916
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,500
They killed your friend, huh?

917
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,500
Some fucking Russians killed my son.

918
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,100
You son of a bitch!

919
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,200
They tortured him and shot him in the head.

920
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,400
You talk to me about your friend?
I don't give a fuck about your friend.

921
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,700
The deal is still on.

922
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,400
Or I'll fucking kill you.

923
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,700
I'll come and find you and I'll fucking kill you.

924
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,600
OK?

925
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,800
Man?

926
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,200
- How did it go?
- Great. Just great.

927
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:12,100
How the fuck are we supposed to get the guns
out of the nuke base with this training exercise?

928
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,300
If Berman's exercise lasts all weekend,
there's no way we're gonna get the guns out.

929
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,300
- The only way is if the exercise finishes early.
- Yeah, man.

930
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,500
If we're not dead by 1700, we're fucking dead.

931
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,500
- I'll take care of it.
- How the fuck are you gonna take care of it?

932
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,200
I said I'll fucking take care of it.

933
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,200
Holy shit.

934
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,500
This place is closed for business, baby.

935
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,500
Get out. Let's go.

936
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,900
What you looking at, son?

937
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,300
You better get on out of here.

938
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,700
Move. Move it.

939
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,200
No, no, no. Not you, Elwood.

940
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,800
You have no authority here, Sergeant.

941
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,700
You can't just walk in here
and close this bar down.

942
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,000
- You have no right.
- You're a real bad motherfucker, ain't you?

943
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,300
Take him to the shed.

944
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,900
- Hey, get the fuck off me.
- Kick his fucking ass.

945
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,100
- Hey, get the fuck off, you bastards.
- Guys.

946
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,100
Fuck off me.

947
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,900
- What do you want?
- A little investment advice.

948
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,200
On what?

949
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,100
How much you think you'll make
on that shipment?

950
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,700
It'll tide me over.

951
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,900
Well, do you know what security on that'll be?

952
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,500
Well, I guess you're here
to give me a price quote.

953
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,700
You know, the thing I love about you, Elwood,

954
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:38,100
is that it don't take you long
to figure out the play.

955
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,600
Get the fuck out.

956
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,700
Get the fuck out.

957
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,800
You stupid fuck. Fuck!

958
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,400
- Fuck. Get out, fuck!
- All right. Calm down.

959
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,300
Fuck.

960
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,400
Fuck.

961
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,100
Motherfucker.

962
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,300
Fuck him. Fuck him.

963
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,000
Stupid motherfucker.

964
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,500
Don't you learn?

965
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,300
Huh? Don't you fucking learn?

966
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,300
You wanna talk business, right?

967
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,500
So let's talk business.

968
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,600
OK.

969
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,200
OK.

970
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,300
Let's talk business.

971
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
You want a cut?

972
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,000
A cut? What the fuck
are you talking about, a cut?

973
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,200
I'm your brand-new fucking partner.

974
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,900
I think you might have saved my life back there.

975
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,200
Thanks. I owe you one.

976
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,900
You OK? They hurt you again?

977
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
No, I just kind of got a sore elbow.

978
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,800
- Listen, I need a favour.
- Yeah. Anything. Anything, man. What is it?

979
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,400
The thing about cooking smack is,

980
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,400
to not get fucked up by the fumes,
you gotta have a full stomach.

981
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,500
Cook smack on an empty stomach,
you'll be stoned as any junkie.

982
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,700
The problem we got now
is we're cooking ten times more than before.

983
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:59,500
So to stay awake,
we have to eat a burger like every 15 minutes.

984
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,100
- So, for six hours, like...
- That's 24 burgers. That's a lot of burgers.

985
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,700
Yeah.
They don't teach you about this stuff in basic.

986
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,100
So, look, I need you to do the shopping for me.

987
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,300
Go into the commissary here and get food.

988
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Burgers, hotdogs - anything with meat.
Lots of meat.

989
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,700
Yeah, OK, no problem.

990
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,700
Catch my drift here, right?

991
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,700
Saad doesn't eat meat.

992
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,500
He's decided to hold back.

993
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,400
He won't come until tonight.

994
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,400
There's no way
he's gonna mount an attack in the day.

995
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,700
I think you may be right, sir.

996
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,200
I know I'm right, Elwood.

997
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,300
He wants to wait till we're worn down,
used up all our supplies, had false alerts.

998
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,800
Two trucks coming, sir.

999
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,600
Aha, breakfast!

1000
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,100
We got fresh coffee, doughnuts,
hash browns, eggs, flapjacks.

1001
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,700
- Garcia, let's get in there.
- Yes, sir.

1002
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,500
- These two trucks, let them through.
- Yes, sir.

1003
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,600
Stop.

1004
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,000
Why the hell did they go over there?

1005
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,500
Go, go, go!

1006
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,500
Move, move!

1007
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,100
Drop your weapons. Move it!

1008
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,500
Bang.

1009
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,600
You're dead.

1010
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,500
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Come on. Let's go.

1011
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,700
Way to run it, way to run it, way to run it.

1012
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,700
Nice play, nice play.

1013
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,100
Here we go. Come on, come on. Line up.

1014
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,800
OK, sir?

1015
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,800
Did I ever tell you I met President Kennedy?

1016
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,200
No.

1017
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,200
He delivered the graduation address
at the academy.

1018
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,100
You can't tell it from his pictures, but...

1019
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,200
up close in person he...

1020
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,300
he just had this charisma.

1021
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,900
I shook the President's hand.

1022
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,700
I felt his strength, and I thought...

1023
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I can do anything I set my mind to.

1024
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,900
Do you know
what General Lancaster called me?

1025
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,700
Incompetent.

1026
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,100
Will he include that in your efficiency report, sir?

1027
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,400
Oh, yeah. Yes, I'm sure he will.

1028
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,200
The General has relieved me of my command.

1029
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,700
Marshall said
his executive officer could take over.

1030
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,600
I'm really sorry, sir.

1031
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,700
You know what I'm gonna do, Elwood?

1032
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,300
I'm gonna take my pension
and buy that vineyard.

1033
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,400
I think that's what I'm going to do.

1034
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,400
That doesn't sound like such a bad idea,
does it?

1035
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,300
Make sure and give the Turk all my love.

1036
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,800
Hey, you feel bad about Berman?

1037
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,800
Oh, fuck, no.

1038
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,500
You don't feel bad about tipping off Marshall?

1039
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,200
I thought you liked Berman.

1040
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,800
Way I see it, I did him a fucking favour.
Berman's too nice a guy for the army.

1041
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,900
I know I did it to save my own ass, but...

1042
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,200
he's gonna make fucking wine.
We're stuck here up to our necks in shit.

1043
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,300
Why the delay? Couldn't find the base?

1044
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,100
- You boys are looking tense.
- We're having a ball.

1045
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,100
Let's get this stuff inside.

1046
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,300
So, how long does it take to cook this stuff?

1047
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,900
Most of the night.

1048
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,400
What the fuck is he doing here?

1049
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,300
He's with me. Got a problem with that?

1050
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,600
Whoa, whoa, Saad,
do me a favour and put that out. Now.

1051
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,400
I'm not fucking around.
This is highly flammable shit.

1052
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,500
Now, listen up. We cook six hours and
we have to keep it as close as possible to 85oC.

1053
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,000
What happens if it goes below?

1054
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,900
If it goes below 80, the reaction stops,
we gotta cook longer.

1055
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:09,000
If it goes above 90, the morphine's destroyed,
and if it boils, well...

1056
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,100
Well, what?

1057
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,800
Cooking smack is like
preparing Thanksgiving dinner

1058
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,900
where one ingredient is a hand grenade.

1059
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,100
This shit explodes?

1060
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,000
- Kaboom.
- You better know what the fuck you're doing.

1061
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I just hope the ventilators can handle it.
This is way more than we've ever done before.

1062
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,300
If we change the filter element every hour,
it should be OK. You on it?

1063
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,300
I'm on it, man.

1064
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,600
Saad, do you want a hotdog?

1065
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,700
I don't want no fucking hotdog.
You got no vegetarian shit?

1066
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:41,200
Hotdogs are made up
of lips, udders and assholes.

1067
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,000
- I'm surprised you don't want one.
- I'll fuck you up.

1068
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,700
Please, just fucking cut the sarcasm.

1069
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:50,800
Can we just eat our hotdogs and chill out?
Not you, of course, Saad.

1070
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,600
OK, six hours. Mark it now.

1071
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:27,700
Knoll.

1072
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.
I'll be back at 0400.

1073
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,800
I'm leaving you in charge, buddy.

1074
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,600
You leaving? Where are you going?

1075
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,000
What are you worried about?

1076
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,800
Just kick back,
watch some TV, educate yourself.

1077
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,800
You own this base, right?

1078
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:45,900
...all afternoon. It is clear that this will be
one of Berlin's most dramatic days.

1079
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,500
Robyn?

1080
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:02,700
Come on up.

1081
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,000
I don't think so.

1082
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,500
Just get up here.

1083
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,700
Come on up. Come on.

1084
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Just a bit further.

1085
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,700
- Jesus Christ, this is not fun.
- What's the matter? Are you scared?

1086
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,200
Of course I'm not scared.

1087
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,900
- I won't push you.
- Yeah, well, I'd appreciate that.

1088
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Come on, come on.

1089
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,700
Come on. Come up to the edge.
Take another step.

1090
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,500
Take another two steps.

1091
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Just a little bit further. Come on.

1092
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,400
Sit down.

1093
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,200
What would it take to make you jump?

1094
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,300
A parachute.

1095
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,600
Oh, fuck.

1096
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,100
That's really high.

1097
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,600
Maybe you get used to it after a while.

1098
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,800
I think the point is not to get used to it.

1099
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,900
What are you doing?

1100
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,700
Why are you putting your arms up like that?

1101
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:25,900
Robyn.

1102
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,700
Oh.

1103
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,200
Fuck it!

1104
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:52,900
Robyn?

1105
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,500
Hi.

1106
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,800
...with growing German opposition
to the siting of nuclear missiles on their soil,

1107
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,600
Brussels changed all that.

1108
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,200
A relieved Chancellor Kohl could now offer
his electorate what they have been demanding.

1109
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,300
The President seemed happy to celebrate...

1110
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,400
I got you.

1111
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,200
Mr President, we're glad you're here.

1112
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,400
You are a friend amongst friends.

1113
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,300
Why do you motherfuckers eat so damn much?

1114
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,900
Because we're growing lads.
We need to keep our strength up.

1115
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Oh.

1116
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,800
- I don't feel too good.
- Mm-hm.

1117
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,500
Let me get one of those burgers.

1118
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,000
No fucking way, Saad. This shit's like poison.

1119
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Wouldn't want you blocking up your arteries.

1120
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Fuck you.

1121
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Fuck you.

1122
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,100
Knoll. Shit, what time is it?

1123
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,300
It's midnight.

1124
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,100
What's going on?

1125
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,100
Where you going?

1126
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,000
- Fuck. I gotta go.
- Can I come?

1127
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,800
They're in there.

1128
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,000
Oh, fuck.

1129
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Leave him alone.

1130
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,200
Stop it!

1131
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,600
Sir, can I ask you to please take her out of here?

1132
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,100
Sir?

1133
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,800
What do you mean "sir"?

1134
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,100
Let me go!

1135
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:53,600
Your Second Lieutenant Brian Knoll
just got out of the Inspector General's office.

1136
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,900
PFC Knoll, our officer in the hole.

1137
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,300
Don't kick.

1138
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:14,200
From the moment the first wave of East
Germans crossed into Berlin in the early hours...

1139
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,700
Where is the Berlin Wall?
- It's in Berlin, you dumb fuck.

1140
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,200
I know it's in Berlin.
What country is it in?

1141
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:24,800
It's in Germany, man.
Fucking... Germany. West Germany.

1142
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,900
West Germany?
Well, which one are we in, then?

1143
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,600
Are we in West Germany
or are we in East Germany?

1144
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,200
We're in East.

1145
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,200
We're in West Germany, you idiot.

1146
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:41,000
- What's the difference?
- Fucked if I know, man.

1147
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,200
Get your fucking hands in the air,
you motherfuckers.

1148
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,300
Get your fucking hands in the air.

1149
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,900
Put it down. I'm warning you.

1150
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,800
Drop that weapon.

1151
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,100
You put your shit down, motherfucker.

1152
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,800
This is my house.

1153
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,200
Drop the fucking weapon.

1154
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,000
No, fuck that.

1155
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,700
Don't make another move.

1156
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,200
You put your shit down. Fuck you.

1157
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,800
Come on.

1158
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:32,900
Come on.

1159
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,700
It's over.

1160
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,600
It's all over.

1161
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,300
What are you doing with Robyn?

1162
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,800
Don't you worry about her.

1163
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,200
She's got nothing to do with you any more.

1164
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,400
Let me go, you fuck!

1165
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,900
Kimborough, you read me?

1166
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,800
Captain Kimborough, come in.

1167
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,500
Er, we got some resistance,
but nothing we can't handle.

1168
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,000
So, you've been putting it to my daughter
and you think that's making war?

1169
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,400
War, you dumb fuck, is playing for keeps.

1170
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,700
Somebody as stupid as you, Elwood,
deserves to go down.

1171
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,300
Take out your muscle, you turn to shit.

1172
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,700
No backup. Too easy.

1173
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:19,300
What?

1174
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,900
Well, who do you think took out Stoney?

1175
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,200
You are fucking stupid.

1176
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,700
He's gonna kill him.

1177
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,800
Can you wait one second?

1178
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,800
Listen to me. My dad is going to kill him.

1179
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,300
- He's gonna do something bad.
- That's ridiculous.

1180
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,300
Where's he taking him? What's he doing?

1181
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,800
- He's taking him to the stockade.
- He's not! The stockade's the other way.

1182
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,600
Can you please see
where he's taking him?

1183
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,600
You wanna hear the secret of Vietnam?

1184
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,300
The secret of Vietnam's simple. I loved it.

1185
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,300
Goddamn turkey shoot.

1186
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,300
Whole damn thing was nothing but fun.

1187
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,300
I'm just being honest.

1188
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,100
I fucking well loved it.

1189
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,900
Everyone else would, too, if we had won.

1190
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,700
I did all sorts of shit.

1191
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,100
Everything you've been doing here and more.

1192
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,200
Lots more.

1193
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,500
And Berliners are proclaiming a new era...

1194
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,900
Let go. Let go. Let go of me!

1195
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,900
Hold it, Sergeant. Get away from the window.

1196
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,200
What are you doing here, sir?

1197
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,900
Get away from the window.

1198
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,600
Or I will shoot you, Sergeant.

1199
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,400
You're gonna shoot me?

1200
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,500
You got the balls to do something like that?

1201
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,900
Boiling point.

1202
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,300
When there is peace,
the warlike man attacks himself.

1203
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:20,500
That's Nietzsche,
and his point is that there really is no peace.

1204
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,900
There's always some war
somewhere with someone.

1205
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,800
And there are no winners or losers, either.

1206
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Just those that are still around
to fight another day.

1207
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,700
A Purple Heart, and er...

1208
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,900
No, what is it?

1209
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,900
Defence Superior Service Medal, sir.

1210
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,900
Gas explosion.
Well, that's what I read in the Stars And Stripes.

1211
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:54,100
- They think it was a gas explosion?
- Yes, sir. That's what they think.

1212
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:58,900
And this er, Robert Lee, the Sergeant
that got the posthumous Silver Star,

1213
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,500
you knew him well, did you?

1214
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,500
Yes, sir. His daughter's my sweetheart.

1215
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,700
Is that right? I didn't know that.

1216
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,900
How's she doing?

1217
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:10,200
She's doing OK, sir.
She's at college studying politics.

1218
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,300
Political science.

1219
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,600
She has her semester break next month
and she's flying over to see me.

1220
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,900
Well, I'll look forward to meeting her.

1221
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,100
Are you sure you're OK standing?

1222
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,800
If the leg starts getting weary,
you just cop a squat.

1223
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,300
Oh, I'll be fine. Thanks, sir.

1224
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,300
OK.

1225
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,100
It really is healing quite nicely.
I think the tropical air's doing it some good.

1226
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,700
So, you like it here in Hawaii?

1227
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,700
- Yeah. I'm settling in.
- That's good. That's good.

1228
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,100
Now, see what have we got here?

1229
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,000
Oh, just some requisitions, sir.

1230
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,100
1,000 gallons of Mop & Glo?

1231
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,300
Do we really need that much?

1232
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:50,100
Well, cleanliness is next to godliness.

1233
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,500
Well, that's what I always say, sir.

1234
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,000
Held Down

1235
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,300
This is dedicated to all my folks

1236
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:05,200
Diagnosed with a bad case
of that proper upbringin'

1237
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,800
And never took the time to fall in line or follow

1238
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,000
Or swallow the thoughts

1239
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,800
Of the recognised committees
who lurk throughout ya cities

1240
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,200
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type

1241
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,900
You're from the same type of people
trying to hold you down

1242
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,800
Just because you tailor-made
for bigger and better things

1243
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,300
Never missed a chance
to move ahead of things

1244
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,500
And what does it bring?

1245
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,600
I tell you for me, it brought jealousy
and back wounds from all the stabbing

1246
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,800
Cats posin' as my fan
just to get to grabbin' what's mine

1247
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,000
I'm livin' in times
where my daughters are found

1248
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,600
Around kids who can't afford thinkin' caps

1249
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,000
But always found drinkin' raps
and eatin' on beats

1250
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,300
Claimin' laws of the streets

1251
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,500
But who made the laws?

1252
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,700
Everybody playin' rebel
with no sign of a cause

1253
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,800
Well, I feel the world around me

1254
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:50,300
I've found that others bring you down
just to be down

1255
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,600
You've got to make up your mind

1256
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,600
Where you wanna be

1257
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,100
Where you wanna go with your life

1258
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,200
With your life

1259
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,200
I'm never singin' the blues
but findin' the clues that maintain

1260
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,400
And I been blessed to reign supreme

1261
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:06,800
Over nearly every dream I had
and I made it come true

1262
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:10,100
I'm an imperfect man
and I'm holding the clue to perfection

1263
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,500
It doesn't seem to matter what direction I look

1264
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,000
I find people settin' traps

1265
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,600
Tryin' to find the goal without havin' any maps

1266
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,600
Even friends of mine

1267
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:20,600
Jump on line just to become my adversary

1268
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:23,100
They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made

1269
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,000
They don't come and chill or behave

1270
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,100
And they got toast ready to burn

1271
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,200
Not learnin' to live

1272
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:29,900
But they yearnin' to take what you earn

1273
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,300
Well, I feel the world around me

1274
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:37,600
I've found that others will bring you down
just to be down

1275
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,800
You've got to make up your mind

1276
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,200
Where you wanna be

1277
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,200
And where you wanna go with your life

1278
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,000
With your life

1279
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,400
So quick to place blame

1280
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,600
And deny the shame we bring upon ourselves

1281
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So many names held accountable
for my own account

1282
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,400
When a large amount was weight

1283
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,800
That I made a shape

1284
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,400
When I climbed I found

1285
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,400
It was hard to find others around
to point my fingers at

1286
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,200
Which made me realise the truth

1287
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,500
The biggest suppressor can be your own ego

1288
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,500
Looking for an excuse to plant roots

1289
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,000
In a field of self-sorrow

1290
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,300
To sprout and follow the first thing you feel

1291
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,500
Nourishes your hunger to be respected

1292
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,500
It gets hectic

1293
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:25,200
And when I'm watching the news
and my daughter walks in

1294
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,600
And choose to ask

1295
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,800
Why were all those people on the floor
sleepin' covered in red?

1296
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:33,000
I told her that they were looking for God
but found religion instead

1297
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,800
Well, I feel the world around me

1298
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:41,100
I've found that others will bring you down
just to be down

1299
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,800
You've got to make up your mind

1300
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,100
Where you wanna be

1301
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,200
And where you wanna be with your life

1302
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,500
With your life

1303
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,500
With your life

1304
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,300
Where you wanna be now

1305
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,600
Sometime

1306
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,600
Sometime...

1307
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,500
I need my space to live

1308
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,700
Well, I feel the world around me

1309
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,000
I've found that others will bring you down

1310
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,200
Others bring you down to be down

1311
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,100
You've got to make up your mind
where you wanna be

1312
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,900
Where you wanna be

1313
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,800
With your life

1314
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:45,700
With your life, with your life

1315
